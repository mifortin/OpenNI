XCode has trouble linking to items within /usr/lib.  This copies the
OpenNI library into a place that XCode will look for:

sudo cp /usr/lib/libOpenNI.dylib /Developer/usr/lib/

Then build Release (or Debug) for i386 or x64 and enjoy!

If it complains about a file not found, make sure that SamplesConfig.xml is in
the same directory as the executable.  The XCode project is set up to pick
the xml from the source directory.
